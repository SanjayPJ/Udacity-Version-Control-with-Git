## Git vs GitHub vs GitLab

Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

Both [GitHub and GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/github-vs-gitlab.html) are cloud-based hosting service for your git repositories.

## Terminology

### commit
Git thinks of its data like a set of snapshots of a mini filesystem. Every time you commit (save the state of your project in Git), it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. So a commit is the fundamental unit in Git
